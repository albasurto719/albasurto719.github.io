# Alex Basurto's Portfolio

This is my coding home page! My name is Alexander Basurto and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science. I want to take the skills I have learned through this course and do my best in the world of programming.

        * Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of the only labs with just one part, but I really enjoyed making our own parking program. We were able to use functions that could determine specific times where someone was able to park where. I was a fan of utilizng command line arguments to identify the days and time permitted for each street.

        * Lab 8

    Lab 8 was great, the main one we learned was in part 2 where we used for loops to creeate a specific pattern in the terminal. I thought it was fun seeing how to use data types like integers and assign them to characters to produce a recognizable image.

        * Lab 9
    Lab 9 was one of my favorite labs. This is the first lab where we create on input file to program a game, and I thought it was really interesting to create a file and actually use it to make the code work. It showcased the depth computer science has at its core and how you can expand upon the original components of coding.
